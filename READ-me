In this problem we consider a matrix in which each cell represents
a number. That number is considered as the time taken for a
person to cross that path. This solution can be used in real time
problems like Google Maps, Ship routes, Airplane routes to reach
in minimum time etc. In this problem we have used the concept of
“DYNAMIC PROGRAMING”. 

The main key governing the program is using the concept of
MEMOIZATION”. “It is a type of dynamic programming in
which each cell is filled corresponding to its adjacent cells finding
the minimum of the adjacent cells and adding the time taken by
that path. That is: -
min(tc[i][j-1], tc[i-1] [j], tc[i-1] [j-1]) + timetaken(tc[i][j])
And after storing all the values we can find the minimum time
taken to reach a given point.
